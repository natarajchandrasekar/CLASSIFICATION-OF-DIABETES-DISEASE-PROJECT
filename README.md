# CLASSIFICATION-OF-DIABETES-DISEASE-PROJECT
The classification of diabetes disease using five distinct machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, decision tree, support vector machine (SVM), and neural networks. The Project aims to compare the performance of these algorithms in accurately predicting diabetes status based on patient medical data .
